# 2D_RPG
Using SDL to create a basic 2D RPG game in Visual Studio.

Todo:

	//Add rendering system

	//Add input system

	//Add player character,

	//Add animation framework,

	create all basic animations (walk, jump, etc)

	Add objects/collision

	Add stats+skills

	Add combat system

	add character progression

	add dialouge

	make a tutorial level

	create save system

	create settings system

if all of the above is done, i'll consider this project finished as the rest is less technical and more creative,
but if am feeling particularly inspired, will potentially do:

	make world map (towns/cities, forests/other random encounter areas, etc)

	add story

	use actual art for animations


tldr;
Basically just do everything that a game needs.
