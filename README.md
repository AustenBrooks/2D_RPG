# 2D_RPG
Using SDL to create a basic 2D RPG game in Visual Studio.

Todo:

	//Add rendering system

	//Add input system

	//Add player character,

	//Add animation framework,

	//create all basic animations (walk, jump, etc)

	//Add objects/collision

	//Add stats

	//Add combat system

	add character progression

	//move the world when the character is in the center
	
	create save system

	create settings system

if all of the above is done, i'll consider this project finished as the rest is less technical and more creative,
but if am feeling particularly inspired, will potentially do:

	add dialouge

	make a tutorial level
	
	make world map (towns/cities, forests/other random encounter areas, etc)

	add story
	
	add skills

	use actual art for animations
	
	randomly generated dungeons?


tldr;
Basically just do everything that a game needs.
